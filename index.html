        <h3>Foot Step Power Generation</h3>

        <p>The system generates voltage using footstep force. The system serves as a medium to generate electricity using non conventional sources(force) and /store/use it. The project is designed to be useful at public places like railway stations where a lot of people keep walking through all day. At such places these systems are to be placed at any entry points where people travel through entrance or exits and they have to step on this device to get through. These devices may then generate a voltage on every footstep and when mounted in series they will produce a sizeable amount of electricity. For this purpose we here use piezoelectric sensors that use piezoelectric effect in order to measure acceleration, force, pressure by
            its conversion into electric signals. We here attach a voltmeter in order to measure its output and small led lights for demonstration.</p>

            <h3>Home Automation System</h3>
            <img src="https://www.hdlautomation.com/vancheerfile/Images/2020/8/20200820010844177.jpg" alt="home automation system" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;">
            <p>SmartThings features: Voice controls with smart home assistants | Easy to use | Compatible with over 5,000 devices

                The thing with home automation systems is that it's important to find one that suits your needs, that is user-friendly to your abilities, and that has good compatibility with the brands or devices you want to stick with -- and SmartThings has both. SmartThings is the best home automation system because, aside from high support among brands, its app promises a straightforward and friendly user interface. 
                
                The navigation on the SmartThings mobile application is highly intuitive: Any favorite devices, scenes, and automations appear as cards right on the app's home screen, with options to add more devices just a tap of a finger away. Editing, adding, and removing automations are also readily available from a menu at the bottom of the screen.</p>

                <h3>Ping Pong Ball</h3>

                <p>Let’s understand the requirements of the game first: Both paddle objects should only be able to move on the y-axis. The ball object should be able to move in a diagonal direction and this can be achieved if we move the ball in both the x and y direction simultaneously. And the ball object’s position and direction should be reset if it moves out of the screen on the x-axis. Both players should be able to control their paddle with their respective keys and this can be done by overriding the keyPressed method of the KeyAdapter interface and changing the coordinates of the paddle.
